### **GDG FOSS Wing Activity**

**Goal:** Create a simple webpage with separate HTML, CSS and JS files and combine them using both **merge** and **rebase** operations as mentioned.

***

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1.  **Fork this Repository**
   
    I think you all know how to do this.

2.  **Clone Your Fork**
   
    Clone your fork to your local machine.

4.  **Create Your HTML Branch**
   
    Now, let's start building! Create and switch to a new branch for your HTML file. **Be sure to include your roll number in the branch name.** Then, create a file named `index.html` inside your project folder and add some simple HTML code. 

5.  **Commit Your HTML**
   
    Stage the `index.html` file, **commit it with a message that includes your roll number** like, "LCS20250AB: {commit message}".

6.  **Create Your CSS Branch**
    
    Switch back to the `main` branch, then create and switch to a new branch for your CSS file. Create a new file named `style.css` in the same folder. Add some simple CSS to change the text color or font, and don't forget to link this CSS file to your `index.html`!

7.  **Commit Your CSS**
   
    Just like before, save your CSS work, **include your roll number in the commit message**, and push it to your repository.

8.  **Create JS file**

    Same as what you did for the HTML and CSS files.

#### **Bringing It All Together!**

This is the most important part! You will now combine your branches using different methods.

1.  **Merge the HTML Branch**
   
    First, switch to your `main` branch and then merge your `HTML` branch into it. This will bring your `index.html` file into the `main` branch and keep a record of the merge.

2.  **Rebase the CSS Branch**
   
    Rebase your `CSS` branch onto the `main` branch.

3.  **Merge the JS Branch**

    Finally, merge your now rebased `main` branch into the `JS` branch.

4.  **Attach Your Git Graph**
   
    To show us your work, please take a clear screenshot of your **Git graph**. Attach this image to your Pull Request.

5.  **Final Push and Pull Request**

    Once all files are in your `main` branch, push your final `main` branch to your repository. Then, go to GitHub and create a **Pull Request** to submit your work for review. **The title of your Pull Request should be your roll number**.

**Have fun, and don't hesitate to ask us questions if you get stuck!**

#### **Bonus Challenge**

You think it's too easy for you? We made some unnecessary commits in updating this README. Can you squash those commits into one? And if you perform this part too, then the title of your PR should be your roll number with a **-i** like, **"LCB20250AB -i"**.
